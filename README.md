# FieaGameEngine
Custom Data Driven game engine written in C++. Featuring custom implementations of stl containers, custom data structures, data parsing system, and Gameobjects that have various components resembling a standard game engine with actions, reactions and an event system.

## The Engine:
At the core of the engine there are the classes:
  **RTTI** - custom base class for runtime type information
  **Datum** - A homogeneous polymorphic container whose type can be determined at runtime through use of a discriminated union.
  **Scope** - A table of strings & datums which forms a dynamic hierarchical database. Datums can be scopes so we can have trees of scopes.
  **Attributed** - A scope derived class which can have prescribed & auxiliary attributes. This allows us to mirror native c++ into a scripting language.
  **TypeRegistry** - singleton that maanges attributed derived classes.
Our scripting language of choice is Json so we have created:
  **Parsing System** - utilizing the chain of responsibily pattern, created a generic parser which in our case we use to parse Scopes from Json.
  **Factory** - implementation of the abstract factory design pattern so we can create objects based on their name in our scripting language.
Now that we have the core and scripting basis of our engine we have several components created that resemble a modern Game Engine:
  **GameObject** - attributed derived class that represents the basis for a "noun" in game. Contains attributes name, transform, child game objects, and actions.
  **Action** - component that represents the "verbs" in our game. to allow an object to implement a type of action.
  **EventSystem** - utilizing the observer design pattern, created an event system that can notify subscribers, and allow for game objects to have reactions.
